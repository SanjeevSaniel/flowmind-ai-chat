## 📊 Migration Guide

### **For Developers Using Speech Hook**
```typescript
// Before v1.2.0
const { transcript, isListening } = useSpeechRecognition()

// After v1.2.0 (Enhanced API)  
const { 
  finalTranscript,    // ✅ Only confirmed speech
  interimTranscript,  // ✅ Real-time preview  
  transcript,         // ✅ Combined display
  isListening 
} = useSpeechRecognition()
```

### **Breaking Changes**
- Speech recognition hook API has new return properties
- Previous `transcript` behavior is now split into `final` and `interim`
- Enhanced error handling may require updated error catching
